# Project2-Udacity-Data-Scientist
As part of the udacity.com Data Scientist nanodegree, this is project two of the program. This project involves a Disaster Response Pipeline showcasing the following Data Science and Software Engineering Best Practices:

* Github and Code Quality including this repository along with comments, docstring in each function, class, or method, unit tests, and logical functions and PEP8 style guideline conventions
* ETL or Extract Transform Load data setup of a clean dataset
* Machine Learning including NLP techniques to process text data and the proper use of pipelines and grid search, traning vs. test data, and model evaluation
* Deployment of our web application showing our Disaster Response Pipeline visualizations

As in my previous project, I have also documented the work in the blog below:

# Libraries Used
| Library | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bootstrap |This was used to simplify writing the HTML5 elements in our web application |
| Flask |This micro web framework was used to write the backend of our web application dashboard |
| Matplotlib |This was the plotting library used for seeing bar charts and plotting data |
| Numpy |This is where numerical constants like np.nan came from|
| Pandas |This is the work horse behind our analysis for reading in the DataFrame from the CSV file and performing various data analysis and preparation |
| Plotly |This was the graphing library used to generate our visualizations |
| Sklearn |Used for encoding categorical columns in order to be able to include them in our linear regression model |

# Summary of the results
TODO: The dataset was imbalanced (i.e. some labels like water have few examples). This imbalance affected training the model...TODO..., and your thoughts about emphasizing precision or recall for the various categories...TODO...

# Acknowledgements
Several code snippets came from previous lessons in our Udacity Data Scientist program. Also, where employed I have credited various contributors from StackOverflow.com, kite.com, and the Data Science Stack Exchange at https://datascience.stackexchange.com. A big thank you to our instructors and all those involved in the Udacity program.
